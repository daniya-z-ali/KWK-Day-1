//Part3
//if someone were to type in if, then "if" turns purple and is expected to let in "if" condition
//maybe a conditional?
// "==" does care about capitalized letters and spaces! This is because code is so specific!
//Maybe because there are so many little key details to making it correct or to process so it is difficult to understand it.
